# Changelog

All notable changes to `filament-topbar-menu` are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0]

### Changed

- **The menu is now rendered with Filament's own topbar and dropdown components**
  (`fi-topbar-nav-groups`, `x-filament-panels::topbar.item`, `x-filament::dropdown`,
  `x-filament::dropdown.list.item`) instead of custom markup and CSS. It is now
  pixel-identical to Filament's native `topNavigation()` menu: same spacing, dark
  mode, dropdown behavior, and it highlights the active item / active group.
- A parent item that has both a URL and children now renders as a dropdown group
  whose first entry is the parent's own link (matching Filament's grouping), rather
  than a link with a separate caret.

### Added

- Active-state highlighting: the item (or dropdown group) pointing at the current
  page is marked active, via new `TopbarMenuItem::isActive()` / `isBranchActive()`.

### Removed

- The bundled CSS asset and its `FilamentAsset` registration — there is no longer
  any custom CSS, so `php artisan filament:assets` is not needed for this plugin.
  The `resources/dist/filament-topbar-menu.css` file and the icon/chevron partials
  were removed.

## [1.1.1]

### Fixed

- Escape the `refresh-favicons` command's translated "not found" label before
  writing it to the console, so a custom/published translation containing `<` or
  `>` can't be misparsed as a Symfony console style tag.

### Added

- This changelog.

## [1.1.0]

### Changed

- **The per-item link target is now authoritative.** "Same tab" (`_self`) always
  opens in the same tab and "New tab" (`_blank`) always opens in a new one.
  Previously, external links were force-promoted to a new tab at render time when
  `open_external_links_in_new_tab` was enabled, even if their target was `_self`.

  The `open_external_links_in_new_tab` config option now only seeds the **default
  value** of the target field when creating a new item; it never overrides an
  explicit choice at render time.

  **Upgrade note:** if you relied on external links auto-opening in a new tab while
  their stored target was `_self`, set those items' target to "New tab" explicitly.

### Added

- Interface translations (`filament-topbar-menu` namespace): English, Russian,
  German, Spanish and French. The language follows the application locale, and the
  files are publishable with `--tag=filament-topbar-menu-translations`.

### Removed

- The internal helpers `TopbarMenuItem::isExternalUrl()` and
  `TopbarMenuItem::normalizeAuthority()`, which are no longer used now that the
  target is honored literally.

## [1.0.0]

- Initial release: configurable topbar menu for Filament 5 via
  `PanelsRenderHook::TOPBAR_LOGO_AFTER`, external/internal links, nested dropdowns,
  favicon resolution, per-item visibility, caching, and a management resource.
